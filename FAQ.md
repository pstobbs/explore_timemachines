### FAQ 1: Why not have the model persist the state?

Answer (A): Well, you can trivially turn any skater function into a callable that does that, should you wish: 

       class Predictor:
   
           def __init__(self,f):
                self.f = f
                self.s = s

           def __call__(self,y,k,a,t,e):
                x, x_std, self.s = self.f(y=y,s=self.s,k=k,a=a,t=t,e=e)
                return x, x_std

or write a decorator. Whatever, it's Python. 

Answer (B): The intent is to produce simple web-service friendly models. 

Answer (C): It's "pure". Sort of. Dict are mutable. Let's say it is as pure as the driven snow that has turned in to sludge in New York City. 

Answer (D): It isn't really a good idea to bundle updating with state maintenance because it isn't a given. Note that in the skater format the caller can request *conditional predictions* easily and doesn't have to worry about unwinding changes (though do need to remember to do a deep copy of the state - see this [note](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines/issues/51) ). 

### FAQ 2: What's with the z-curves and *r* parameter?

The idea is that *any* black-box optimizer should be able to optimize *any* time-series "pre-skater" without a human providing interpretation of hyper-parameters. So we force pre-skaters to expose at most a single scalar hyper-parmeter, but also supply suggested space-filling curves. This...

- is hopefully a *reasonable* way to map the most important hyper-parameter choices,
- that imposes some geometric discipline on the hyper-parameter space in the first place, and

and, as noted, facilitates comparison of different ways to search hyper-parameters, across packages which have *entirely different conventions* and hyper-parameter spaces. 

### FAQ 3: Why not use the "big name" packages, like prophet, directly?

Answer (A) They kinda suck, for one thing. Perhaps that's why 15,000 people read [this article](https://www.microprediction.com/blog/prophet) in a single day. Don't be the last.  

Answer (B) In all seriousness, knock yourself out. Use whatever you like. Observe that this package wraps *some* functionality, not all by any means, of some popular open source packages. But honestly the slow ones are here, along with the [Elo ratings](https://microprediction.github.io/timeseries-elo-ratings/html_leaderboards/univariate-k_003.html), mostly to reassure you that speed comes for free. You're probably gaining accuracy, not losing it, when you adopt a faster algorithm and ignore the latest exhortation to use FAANG-XYZ, written by some noob on Towards Data Science.   

Answer (C). Given the above, you might not want to wed yourself to the quirks of a particular packages' API. You *might* like this package if you want to be able to do this:

        s,k = {}, 3
        for yi,ai in zip(y,a[k:]): 
            xi, xi_std, s = f(y=yi,s=s,k=k,a=ai)

and swap out *f* when it doesn't perform for you. 

Notice what isn't here: 
 - Pandas dataframes
 - A long list of methods and properties 
 - Column naming conventions 
 - The customary 10-50 lines of setup code before a prediction can be made,
 - The customary need to trace into the code to infer intent, including which parameters are supposed to be supplied. 
 - Possible confusion between variables known in advance and those observed contemporaneously,
 - Possible confusion about prediction horizon,
 - Possible conflation of 3-step ahead prediction with the 1-step ahead prediction applied three times, 
 - Datetime manipulation, and conventions like '5min' which not everyone agrees on. 


### FAQ 4: What are the drawbacks? 
Autonomous prediction is hard and in this world there are only only subsidized lunches, not free ones.  

There are also limitations of the skater approach. The simple data model in *y*, *a* is not well suited to problems where exogenous data comes and goes, and therefore cannot easily be represented by a vector of fixed length (you might consider a dictionary interface instead, as with
the river package). 

There is, at time of writing, also a shortage of skaters that exploit anything beyond the first entry in 'y' (exogenous vars), or use 'a' (known in advance). So think of this package as mostly univariate, for now. 

### FAQ 5: Why do skaters only return two numbers per horizon, instead of a full distribution? 

Yes, the skater does not return a full distribution - unless you smuggle it into the state. 
However this package was motivated by the desire to create better free turnkey distributional forecasts, at [microprediction.org](https://www.microprediction.org), and you might infer that skaters returning two numbers per horizon might be useful 
as part of a chain of computations that eventually produces a distributional estimate. Skaters can be considered linear transforms
of incoming data, and part of the agenda here is figuring out how to judge skaters
in a manner that better reflects downstream use in distributional estimates. Here the theory of proper scoring rules doesn't really suffice, it would seem. End of aside.
