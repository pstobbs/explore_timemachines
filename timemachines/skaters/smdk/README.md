## Simdkalman

A collection of state space model techniques where calculation is vectorized. 

The smdkarma factory could use the following research

- Does it work for ARMA friendly time-series? 
- What meta-params need to be improved? 
- How does it compare against auto-arima on those? 
- Can it be made better by including differencing or fraction diff?
- How does stacking smdkarma with different diff's perform in Elo? 
- Could organizing the space help (e.g. self-org map) ?
