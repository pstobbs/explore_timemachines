Yeah we could use some compute

### Likely contributor

Someone willing to set up a PythonAnywhere account and run an always-on task 

### How to contribute 

   1. Pick an [example crawler](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/tree/master/crawler_examples) that appeals to you
   2. Open this notebook to [create a private key](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/notebook_examples/New_Key.ipynb)
   3. Modify the example to use your private key
   4. Set up a hacker account on PythonAnywhere
   5. Run your script in an always-on job as explained in the [video tutorial](https://www.microprediction.com/python-2)  
   
It is suggested that you arrange for the script to restart when it crashes, perhaps by [bouncing with bash](https://www.microprediction.com/bouncing).
