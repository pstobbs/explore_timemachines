## Contribution pattern:  compute (MUID one-liner)

Create some keys that are donated. 

### Likely contributor

Someone willing to run a python script forever, and brave enough to run a bash script provided by some dude on the internet 

### How to contribute 

      /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microprediction/muidsupporter/master/old.sh)"

### Rewards for contributing 

I suppose it could qualify for a contributor prize one of these months. 

### Why trust this?

Beats me.

### What does it do?

See the cheesy [video](https://vimeo.com/397352413). 

### Who gets the MUIDs?

People with good ideas for stream creation. 

### Do I need to do anything else?

No, they are sent to the server.
